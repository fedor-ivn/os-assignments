The results are similar to those obtained in exercise 3, with some inaccuracy.
Despite that we timely block parts of the code for other threads, the main
workload that is `is_prime` function is still executed in parallel. Thus, the
elapsed (real) and CPU (user) time have the same rates of change in both
experiments. However, the CPU time spent in kernel (sys) has increased, because
mutexes are kernel objects and require system calls.
