Generally speaking, we notice the boost in time perfomance as we increase the
number of threads. The CPU (user) time spent stays the same since we compute
primes for the same range. However, wall-clock elapsed (real) time decreases
till the fourth case (n=10000000, m=10). I suppose that in first three cases the
threads are executed truly parallel since my machine has enough processor cores.
But starting with fourth one, threads are executed concurrently, so the real
time also stops decreasing.
