Foremost, I changed the conditions of experiment to analyze the expected
behaviour. Specifically, I increased the portion of memory to 1.5 GB.
The reason was that my machine has 16 GB of memory, so ten allocations of 10 MB
did not affect `si` and `so` values.

From the experiment in changed conditions, I noticed that `si` and `so` values
did not change till the 6th iteration. From the 7th iteration, the `so` value
started to grow. So, the operating system started to _swap out_ to disk since
all the physical RAM was already allocated. However, `si` value also started to
grow, maybe because the pages of more prioritized processes were _swapped in_.
On the last iteration, operating system killed the process.
