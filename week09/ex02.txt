Let us consider the runs of two different sequences with 2 page frames.

# 1. Increased ratio
Content of input.txt: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
Results:
    Table size:        2
          Hits:        8
        Misses:        1
Hit/Miss ratio: 8.000000

# 2. Decreased ratio
Content of input.txt: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`
Results:
    Table size:        2
          Hits:        0
        Misses:        9
Hit/Miss ratio: 0.000000

In the first case, the ratio increases till 8.0, since the algorithm references
the same page 9 times. First reference results in 1 miss. The page fault
occures, so the referenced page is swapped in. The latter references result in 8
hits.

In the second case, the ratio is decreased till 0.0, since the algorithm
references different pages each time. Every reference results in a miss, since
the reference sequence has no repeats.
